The developmental synapse remodeling software is a python toolbox for the analysis of synapse turnover dynamics 
in experimental data and model fitting as described in [Nakajo et al.](#references)


## Installation

This package was developed using `python 3.11` and has minimal dependencies on `numpy`, `scipy`, `matplotlib`, `tqdm`.

We recommend installation via conda using the [`environment.yml`](environment.yml) file

    >>> conda env create -f environment.yml

## Running

The `scripts` folder contains exmaple and analysis scripts:

* [`example.py`](./scripts/example.py) runs the code with simple example simulations of the model. 

* [`analysis.py`](./scripts/analysis.py) performs the full analysis and reproduces the figures from [Nakajo et al.](#references).

A sample simulation as generated in the example script looks like this:

![model](./figures/model_example.png)

indicating the individual synapses getting born into the new dynamic state (blue) and either decaying or switching into
a stable state (orange) before decaying at a slower rate.
